# LoL-Champ-Analysis
 An analysis of League of Legends Champion stats

 To get the most recent champion stats to run the analysis from my blogpost you will want to get a temporary development API key from Riot (https://developer.riotgames.com/). Since we are just using the API key once to pull the data we don't need to register a product. Instead we just need to regenerate an API key that will be good for 24hr.

 With an API key generate download and walk through the "LoL API Data Download.ipynb" notebook to get the latest data and clean it up for analysis.

 If you want skip the API step you can jump right into the "LoL Champion Analysis.ipynb" notebook and pull in my latest LoL_champs.csv.
